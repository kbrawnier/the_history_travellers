            Nathan grew up in the woods. He remembered stepping in father’s footsteps following
            a game trail in the Ohio River Valley. Everyone else knew his father
            as Daniel Boone, but to Nathan, he was his best friend. They would hunt together, explore
            together, and run his father’s various business ventures together. Nathan was the youngest of 10.  
            When he was 10 years old, his father was elected to the Virginia Assembly for the third time, 
            for the second time in his life Nathan would go to Richmond, VA with his father and mother. 
            At one point, Nathan interrupted the assembly by telling the sergeant at arms he had an 
            urgent message for his father. When his father rushed out for the urgent message, 
            Nathan asked him for spending money. 
        </p>
        <p class = "tab">
            Daniel would often take Nathan on his excursions into the woods. 
            Hunting with his father wasn’t all fun and games, though. It could be quite dangerous. 
            There was one hunting trip that Daniel took Nathan into the woods that the local 
            Native Americans claimed as their own. When Daniel realized that a band of Natives 
            had found their camp, Daniel put their supplies and furs in the boat, had Nathan 
            hide under the furs and floated down the river under a foggy cover. Nathan’s 
            experiences as a child would help to form his character that would lead him on for 
            the rest of his life.
        </p>
        <p class = "tab">
            His father was talking to his brother, Daniel Morgan, again. He had come back from the
            Spanish territory of Missouri two years ago with a message from the Lieutenant Governor.
            It said that Spain would give Daniel Sr. and the men in his family about 1,000 acres each
            to move to Missouri and Daniel would receive about 338 to about 507 acres for each
            family that they brought with them. The lieutenant governor also made it clear that the
            law about being catholic in order to move to Missouri couldn’t be enforced
            on the frontier. With much deliberation, such an amazing offer, and with the Boones getting
            restless with more and more people moving near to them, they packed up their belongings,
            put them into boats and Nathan and his brothers took the boats down the Ohio River past Cincinnati and Louisville,
            till they reached the Mississippi River near present day Cape Girardeau
            then they took the Mississippi to St. Charles, MO, while Daniel and a hired hand took the
            animals overland following the path of the river. There was only one problem and her name
            was Olive Van Bibber. She was the love of Nathan’s life. She had lived 20 miles upriver when
            the Boones were living in the Kentucky territory and leaving her must have been very hard
            on them both. So, at 18 years old, with his father’s permission, Nathan left the group
            before they had even reached the Mississippi River, in fact, he only made it to Limestone,
            KY about 75 miles downriver (now known as Maysville) before he headed back upriver.
            Upon reaching Olive’s house he asked her hand in marriage and they wasted no time
            getting married and heading back downriver to meet with his parents. Unfortunately,
            since he had not been with his father when they had reached St. Louis, he wasn’t given any
            land by the Spanish government, but he was able to trade for about 680 acres about 4 miles 
            from his brother Daniel Morgan’s land on the Femme Osage River. Just five years after Nathan
            and Olive arrived in St. Louis the US would buy the Louisiana Territory including the territory 
            of Missouri. 
        </p>
       
        <p class = "tab">
            Nathan tried his hand at farming, but it wasn’t right. He longed to go to the woods like his father. 
            He started spending winters hunting and trapping where he made more money than farming. 
            One season, a friend and he would trap beaver on the Grand river in North Missouri, 
            taking over 900 pelts. Even though they lost 100 pelts to natives, they would make a 
            combined $1600 (over $35,000 today) selling the pelts in Lexington, KY.
        </p>
        <p class = "tab">
            Not every expedition would end in riches for Nathan, though. It was the fall of 1804, Nathan
            and Olive’s brother, Mathias Van Bibber, had left to go trap the Grand River with plans to 
            trap the Kansas River, where Nathan had trapped just the season before. They never made it 
            to the Kansas River though. They were confronted by natives who then proceeded to take their 
            horses, furs and anything else of value, warned them that there was another party tracking them and the second party 
            would not be so kind. Nathan and Mathias soon found out that they were told the truth. When 
            the second party caught up with them, Nathan and Mathias were lucky to get away having just 
            lost powder, lead and flints, instead of their lives as well. With no furs or heavy blankets, 
            the men had to travel across Missouri in the dead of winter with only five bullets. They were 
            able to get one turkey, but eventually, the cold would get so bad that it warped the barrels and 
            sights of their guns. This made it impossible to get any more game. They would waste their last 
            four shots trying to shoot something. They travelled 17 days without meat surviving by eating what 
            they could gather in the woods. At one point they stumbled upon a tree that had been used for 
            target practice and were able to pull enough lead out of the tree to make some more shot.
            They found a cougar in an abandoned cabin they were going to make camp in and using the shot, finally, 
            had meat. The very next day, they stumbled into the camp of some friends. At this point, their pants 
            were half gone since they used the material to patch their moccasins. They were able to rest for a week 
            and head on home about another 100 miles, but for this trek they had warm clothes, blankets,
            plenty of shot, flint and powder. When Nathan finally stepped into his cabin on the Femme Osage 
            River it was Christmas Eve. Later in life Nathan and Olive would be interviewed by Lyman Draper, 
            who had walked all the way from Madison, WI to the Boone Mansion near modern day Springfield, Missouri, for
            his book about Nathan’s father, Daniel. In the Draper Interviews, Olive Boone would say that 
            “It was the first Christmas he had spent at home since our marriage, and I have the Indians to 
            thank for that.” Unfortunately, Mathias never recovered and after two or three years died. Nathan 
            on the other hand was out the door as soon as the weather changed. He was going to track down his 
            lost supplies. He went the Osage tribes of western Missouri whom he had thought had had a hand in stealing 
            his equipment but came home with only two traps.

        <p class = "tab">
            These times hunting and trapping in the woods, as well as dealing diplomatically with the 
            natives of the area would soon come to the attention of the Governor of the Louisiana territory 
            and the Brigadier General of the Territory's militia, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark respectively. 
            Soon enough, they would need Nathan’s expertise to help guide an expedition to found a new fort.
