      <description>We&#39;re Kendon and AndrewWhen most people think of Nebraska they think of cows and cornfields. Growing up in Lincoln, we saw plenty of those, but we saw another side of Nebraska that is easily forgotten. We were introduced to the outdoors before we can remember. Before Andrew was even one year old our parents took us on a road trip from Nebraska to New Mexico and back.</description>

      <description>The Trapper  Nathan grew up in the woods. He remembered stepping in father’s footsteps following a game trail in the Ohio River Valley. Everyone else knew his father as Daniel Boone, but to Nathan, he was his best friend. They would hunt together, explore together, and run his father’s various business ventures together. Nathan was the youngest of 10. When he was 10 years old, his father was elected to the Virginia Assembly for the third time, for the second time in his life Nathan would go to Richmond, VA with his father and mother.</description>
