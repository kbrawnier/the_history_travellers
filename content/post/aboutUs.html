        When most people think of Nebraska they think of cows and cornfields. Growing up in Lincoln, we saw plenty of those, 
        but we saw another side of Nebraska that is easily forgotten. We were introduced to the outdoors before we can remember. 
        Before Andrew was even one year old our parents took us on a road trip from Nebraska to New Mexico and back. 
        We would listen to the birdsong along the trails of the Spring Creek Audubon Center, camped on the beach of Lake McConaughy, 
        hiked the wooded trails of Pioneers Park and discovered history at Homestead National Monument. 
        We would also camp in the mountains of Colorado with our cousin.

        We love history. It has gone hand in hand with our love of the outdoors. As kids, 
        our grandma took us to the bicentennial commemeration of Lewis and Clark's expedition in 2004. 
        They reenacted the expedition stopping for an event on the banks of the Missouri River in Omaha, NE. We can remember nights when our mother would
        read us books like “Little House on the Prairie”, going to Floyd's 
        Bluff Monument in Sioux City, Iowa with our mom and exploring the little steamboat Lewis and 
        Clark Museum that was on the Missouri River in Sioux City, IA. The love of history was revived when we visited our Great Uncle. We visited his wife and him at their house in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
        They took us to quite a few of the historical sites in the area such as Bandelier, Los Alamos, and Glorieta Pass. His passion for history
        was contagious and we couldn’t help but be infected by it.

        Enough about us! What is our mission with this blog? We have loved history and the outdoors.
        We want to be able to bring that love of history and nature to you! There are some very interesting historical
        figures that most people don't know about and we want to bring you their stories in a format that will
        inspire and educate our readers to get outside more, to learn more, and most importantly be curious.
